Textbook
========

Our (required) textbook is the blue 
[Analysis: With an Introduction to Proof (5th edition)](http://isbn.nu/9780321747471 "isbn.nu compare prices") textbook by Steven R. Lay.
Pre-class reading and homework assignments are posted on 
[Moodle Reading Forum](https://moodle.gac.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=40817).


Overview
========

This course aims to provide a transition from introductory calculus to higher mathematics. In particular, to develop skills in mathematical communication: oral, written, and typeset;
to develop critical thinking skills;
to introduce and practice techniques of mathematical proof.

---------

Expectations
------------

**Definitions**.
By the end of each section, you are expected to:

* state definitions accurately
* identify whether or not an object meets the conditions of a given definition
* give examples that satisfy a given definition
* give examples that do not satisfy a given definition

**Theorems**.
By the end of each section, you are expected to:

* state theorems accurately
* given a theorem, identify their assumptions and their conclusions
* determine whether the conditions of a theorem do or do not hold in a given situation, 
* determine what a theorem does or does not imply in a given situation

Assessments and grading

Tokens
======

Tokens are fake currency which may be spent on second attempts for in-class exams, take-home exams, and Overleaf writeups as well as late submissions:

|Purpose|Token cost |
|:-------|:----------|
| Retake an in-class exam (if you pass fewer than 85% solutions on your most recent attempt) or take a late make-up exam| 1 token|
|---
| Resubmit an unsuccessful (or late) Overleaf final draft within 7x24 hours of deadline | 1 token |
{: rules="groups"}
<br>

You start out with three (3) tokens. You may use a token for any reason (sports and extracurricular activities, sickness, forgetting to wake up, etc). You don't need to explain your reasons.

Note: If you attempt something more than once, only the outcome of the *last* attempt will be recorded.

**Early make-up** 
If you know in advance that you will have an excused absence, you may schedule an early make-up exam or quiz (with a 7-day notice) without using any token.

****

Assessments
===========

**In-class Presentations**
You will take turns presenting solutions to a list of problems.
Your presentation does not need to be perfect, but it should show evidence of a serious effort. You should be prepared to answer questions from other students.

Note that if you let me know in advance that you cannot be in class on a specific day for any reason, then I may be able to choose a different day to run presentations (so that your absence will not affect your grade directly).

**Audience participation**
During a presentation, you will be asked to be present and engaged.
When you do not understand part of the presenter's explanation, 
you must let the presenter know and ask them to clarify.
See the previous paragraph for a note on absence.

**Overleaf writeup**.
You will be assigned a written work every non-exam week (most will be done individually and the more challenging ones will be done in groups).
The first draft is due on Wednesday at 10am, and the final draft is due on Monday the following week.

You are free to discuss your work with me, other students in the class, and others (be sure to credit your resources).
Unless I tell you otherwise, you will schedule a meeting with me on Wednesday or Thursday outside of class to revise your submission. You may request a second feedback (and third) after this meeting.

An Overleaf writeup that is not successful will not be counted towards your grade. However, a written work can be resubmitted past the deadline at the cost of one token.


**Weekly quizzes**.
You will be given a list of definitions, theorems, and exercises (which answers have been discussed in class or are in the back of the section/book). 
You will need to be able to state definitions and theorems properly. You will also be asked to recognize and provide examples of situations where a definition or theorem does or does not apply. 
You may re-take or make up *two* quizzes in my office during the semester (no token needed).

**In-class Exams**.
In-class exams will assess your mastery of definitions, statements of theorems, and proofs from the textbook or lectures. In addition to questions asked of you during the quizzes, you will be asked to construct proofs of theorems which *you have seen before*. Because you have seen the list of all possible questions, the grading standard for these are higher than on the take-home exams. You are welcome to ask for feedback on your prepared solutions up to the day *before* the in-class exam day.

You can retake an in-class exam at the cost of a token. Only the most recent outcome will be counted toward your grade. Different questions (from the same list) will be chosen for your second attempt.

**Take-home Exams**.
Take-home exams will assess you ability to write new proofs on your own. 
You may not discuss the take-home exam with anyone other than me.
During the exam, you may not look at resources other than your textbook and notes.
You may ask me to look over your exam before submitting it, but I may not answer your questions directly.

Because take-home exams are more challenging than your other tasks (that is, you don't get unlimited attempts or resources), the grading standards will be lower than the Overleaf writeup. Each problem will be graded successful, quasi-successful, or unsuccessful. 

<!--You can retake a take-home exam at the cost of a token, to be scheduled within one week of getting your graded exam back. Only the most recent outcome will be counted toward your grade. -->

**Project**
The project is only required if you wish to earn a B or above.
You will pick a section from the textbook (or another real analysis/proof-based calculus resource approved by me) which is not covered this semester. I will post a list of suggested sections, but you can choose a different topic as long as I approve it beforehand.

You will assign the class a short reading assignment which includes highlighting several important definitions and theorems from your chosen section.
Then you will give a lecture (30 minutes) on these definitions and theorems.
Your leture proposal (consisting of reading assignment and lecture notes typed in LaTeX) must be first approved by me before you can present.

Your proposal first draft is due two weeks before your presentation day, and your final draft is due one week before your presentation day. 
The presentation day will fall in April or May.

<!---
**Glossary of terms and theorems**
You will submit a list of definitions and theorems typed in LaTeX which help you study. I will provide a template to help you with this task. These are to be arranged in some logical order that makes sense to you, for example, alphabetically or chronologically. Your final draft will be collected at the end of April, but I will check on your progress in March. 
-->

**Grading errors**
If you notice any grading mistake or have grading questions that are specific to your work, please talk to me *during office hours*. This must be done within a week after you receive your graded work.

Academic honesty and collaboration policy
-------

**Any substantive contribution or help to your submitted work by another person or taken from a website or publication should be properly acknowledged in writing (by citing the source). Failure to do so is plagiarism and will necessitate disciplinary action.**

**Exams**. During an exam (including take-home exams), you may not discuss the exam with anyone other than me (the instructor). You may not use sources other than the textbook (for example, you cannot consult other textbooks or the internet.)

**Overleaf writeup**. As a guideline for collaboration, I encourage students to get together in small groups to discuss problems. The Overleaf writeup you submit should be your own work (except that you may use other people's LaTeX code). If your writeup was inspired by a class presentation, this should be cited. Internet and other non-textbook resources are allowed on non-exam assignments (with proper citations).

**Group assignments**. Anything taken from a source outside the group should be properly cited. In addition, all team members must stand behind all reports bearing their names. Do not include someone's name in a submission if they do not contribute to the work.

**Actions that would cause you to be guilty of plagiarism include the following:**

* Any evidence of collaboration between students or use of internet resources on an exam
* Discussing an exam question (while you or someone else is still working on the exam)
with someone other than the instructor.
* Handing in a proof (partially or fully) done by someone else under your own name.
* Reading someone else's proof (for example, from another textbook or the internet) and submitting it as your own work.


As a student at Gustavus you are expected to uphold the Honor Code and abide by the Academic Honesty Policy. Read about the <a href="https://gustavus.edu/general_catalog/current/acainfo">Academic Honesty Policy</a>.

 The first violation will result in no credit for the assignment or exam in question (tokens cannot be used in these situations). The second violation will result in an F in the class. Both times, an honor code violation report will be submitted.
